# Missing OG Image

## Required: Create og-image.png

The site references `/assets/og-image.png` for social sharing (Open Graph and Twitter cards) but this file doesn't exist yet.

### Specifications:
- **Dimensions**: 1200x630 pixels
- **Format**: PNG
- **Content**: Should include:
  - MySubscribe logo
  - App name: "MySubscribe"
  - Tagline: "iOS Subscription Tracker App"
  - Key value prop: "Track all your subscriptions in one place"
  - Visual: Screenshot of the app or clean branded design
  - Brand colors: #007AFF (primary blue), #00D4FF (accent)

### Why it matters:
This image appears when your site is shared on:
- Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp (Open Graph)
- Twitter/X (Twitter Cards)
- Slack, Discord, and other social platforms

Without this image, social shares will look unprofessional and may hurt click-through rates.

### Quick fix:
You can create this using:
- Figma/Canva with the template dimensions
- Screenshot of your app with branded overlay
- Design tool like Photoshop or Sketch

Place the final file at: `/public/assets/og-image.png`
